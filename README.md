# Automated Personalized Mailer

*Author* : [Renco Steenbergen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renco-steenbergen-87b52a119/)

*Summary* : Java mailing tool that can be used to send multiple e-mails with the same content, including personalized salutations. 

*IDE* : IntelliJ IDEA, Notepad++

## Purpose
This is a Java mailing tool that can be used to send a personal e-mail to multiple adresses. 

Example:
If multiple e-mails with the same content need to be sent, one to Joe, one to Chris and one to Daisy. It is nice to send them an e-mail and say 'Hi' without calling them by name, but it makes an e-mail even more personalized when both Joe, Chris and Daisy are called by name. That is what this tool is for!
